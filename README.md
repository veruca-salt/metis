# Improving digital collaboration at the border

## Problem we’re trying to solve

The civil service is organised into departmental silos each of which has clearly defined boundaries reflecting their responsibilities.  These boundaries make it hard for digital teams to work together across government to improve digital services.   

Because the structure of the government is reflected in the way our systems are designed and built this can create problems when end user service journeys do not match neatly with our internal organisation.  

Take for example the services we run at the border:   fundamental tasks - like exporting a product to another country - involve many different processes operated by several departments.   Users must interact with multiple technology solutions and are repeatedly asked for the same data from different sources. 

Longer term investments may create new organisational and technology solutions to resolve this type of problem, but this research asks whether it is possible to make it easier for digital teams to collaborate across government on shared solutions given the constraints of our departmental structures and in the short term (months rather than years).

Recent work by Government Digital Services (GDS), the Border Delivery Group (BDG) and the Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA) assuring technology delivery in preparation for Brexit has highlighted both the enthusiasm amongst delivery teams to work more closely with one another and the obstacles to making it happen.

We’ve encountered several common themes that we hope to find more about during this research: 

### LEGACY IT

Many of our border systems are old, and some are end-of-life.   Departments are understably keen to rid themselves of these costly and inflexible solutions, but the subsequent investments - when justified primarily on cost and risk reduction - can tie up expertise and technical capabilities in lengthy projects that often prioritize replacing the old technology rather than considering how processes can be improved from an end user perspective.

The long history of departmental silos have created specialisms and jargon that are hard for those outside to follow.  This is reflected in the language the teams use, the data models they work with and the operational processes they develop.   These differences can become major barriers when teams try and work together to solve common problems.

The data and technologies used in legacy systems is often only understood by a small number of technical specialists and this makes it hard for other departments to get information and can leave the experts isolated and working on critical, but low visibility, maintenance and support work.

Policy decisions and investment strategies do not always have the necessary input from the digital teams who will deliver the solutions, and digital teams often lack the authority to influence policy change  based on the practical implications of delivering the policy intention, and this reduces opportunities to coordinate technical work between teams.

### DATA

We do not have a strong culture for sharing our data inside government via APIs.  The most mature examples of API culture - for example at HMRC - are driven primarily by the need to satisfy an external market of commercial 3rd party software developers rather than through a drive to share data in government.  

The barriers to API development are not just financial, but are also linked to our attitude to taking on risk and long term commitments on behalf of teams outside our normal domains.

Data can be poor quality - either because of unavailability (data is not collected or not sharable), or because it is available too late to be useful or because it us unreliable because of errors, gaps and duplication.  

Data is generally not organised in a way that makes it convenient to use outside the area that collected it.

### IDENTITY

There is no single list of people and organisations involved in border transactions which makes it hard to stitch together processes managed by different departments.

Other identifiers for key entities are used inconsistently and are implemented differently between departments.

### SECURITY

Time and money is lost because of confusion about data sharing rules regarding privacy and data security classifications.   An air of mythology persists around these topics and misunderstandings can cause good ideas to fail early.

### EXPERIENCE

Basic facilities that you’d expect to find in any large corporation are not available to delivery teams trying to work together across government (one email directory, common collaboration and document sharing tools etc).

We do not have a common view on the user personas that interact with multiple government departments at the border.

Departmental border strategies are hard to locate and are not tied together by any kind of cross government technology strategy for systems at the border.

Government has built multiple successful public cloud platforms but it is hard for these capabilities to be shared with other departments, even when that makes sense from a delivery perspective.

Inconsistent ways of working and reporting, combined with the lack of any central kind of staff directory, makes it hard to find colleagues working in similar areas and, when they are found, it is not always easy to get permission to start up a discussion or to make decisions to build things together.

Government Digital teams now work in the open, but it is not clear this has turned into a culture where we regularly contribute to one another's open source projects.


## What happens if we don’t do this

* Significant changes at the border - like those that will follow Brexit - will be hard to respond to rapidly.   For now, the easiest way for departments to work quickly is to isolate themselves and work in parallel, but this can create missed opportunities to reuse technology and to simplify processes for traders.
* Some changes - e.g attempts to improve flow at the border - simply can’t be made effectively in isolation within one department and the inertial created by our silo’d approach may prevent some impactful changes ever happening effectively.
* We will continue to miss out on risking and compliance opportunities until we find better ways for teams to exchange data.
* While teams continue to specialise we lose opportunities to move them between departments, spreading knowledge and reducing risk.
* Users will continue to be inconvenienced by a disjointed experience at the border
* Management and policy bandwidth will be spent trying to sort out problems caused by incompatible technologies that might have been avoided if cross-government delivery teams had more opportunities to talk at the design stage
* We will perpetuate the feeling of waste and isolation that results from working alone on problems you know have already been solved elsewhere


## The approach

We will arrange interview sessions with key delivery staff who worked on preparing digital systems at the border for Brexit.

We will review examples of working collaboration (desk based research) 
- Slack, communities, Government Shared Services, TLN etc

The results will be turned into a prioritised list of themes and some recommendations and a request for funding.  Blog post to follow.
